## 🎯 Upload in 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Get Hugging Face Token

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Click "New token"
3. Name it "model-upload"
4. Select **"Write"** permissions
5. Copy the token

### Step 2: Run Upload Script

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the upload script
python upload_to_huggingface.py
```

The script will:
- ✅ Ask for your Hugging Face token (paste it when prompted)
- ✅ Ask for your username
- ✅ Create repository: `your-username/handwritten-equation-solver`
- ✅ Upload all 4 files (~56 MB total)
- ✅ Display the URL to your model

**Upload time: ~2-5 minutes** (depending on internet speed)

### Step 3: Test Your Model

After upload completes, test that it works:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual Hugging Face username
python test_huggingface_model.py --repo_id YOUR_USERNAME/handwritten-equation-solver
```

This will:
- ✅ Download model from Hugging Face
- ✅ Load and verify model
- ✅ Run test inference
- ✅ Confirm everything works
